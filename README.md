## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Running

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p-karthik-eng/profile-assignment
cd profile-assignment
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/users
```

You can adjust this URL for production as needed.

### 4. Start the mock API server

```bash
npm run server
```

This runs `json-server` on `http://localhost:3001`.

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### 6. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Approach & Optimizations

### State Management & Persistence

- **Redux Toolkit** is used for global state management, ensuring all profile data and API statuses are accessible throughout the app.
- **localStorage** is used for data persistence. On app load, the profile is loaded from localStorage if available, ensuring the user's data persists across page refreshes and browser restarts.

### API Integration

- All profile CRUD operations (create, update, delete) are performed via RESTful API calls to a mock backend (`json-server`).
- The API base URL is configured via environment variables, making it easy to switch between development and production environments.

### Form Handling & Validation

- The profile form uses strong validation:
  - Name: Required, minimum 3 characters.
  - Email: Required, must be valid.
  - Age: Optional, must be a number if provided.
- Errors are shown inline and via MUI Snackbar for a smooth user experience.

### Routing

- **React Router** is used for navigation between the profile form, profile display, and a custom 404 page.
- Invalid routes automatically redirect to the 404 page.

### UI/UX

- **Material-UI (MUI)** provides a modern, accessible, and responsive design.
- All dialogs (delete confirmation, errors) use MUI's Dialog component for consistency and better UX.
- Buttons use icons and color coding for clarity.
- The form and dialogs are centered and styled for a professional look.

### Error Handling

- All API and validation errors are caught and displayed using MUI Dialogs or Snackbars, never as raw alerts.
- The app gracefully handles missing data, failed API calls, and invalid routes.

### Environment Variables

- The app uses Vite's environment variable system (`VITE_API_URL`) to configure the API endpoint.
- Easily switch between development and production by changing the `.env` file.
